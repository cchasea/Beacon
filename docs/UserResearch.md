## Observation 1 (Team Name):
- ### Observation Statement:
  Focus group participants expressed confusion or uncertainty about our team name, noting that it doesn’t clearly represent the app’s purpose or functions.

- ### Supporting Data:
  Multiple survey responses mentioned that the team name felt vague or unrelated to scheduling or organization. Only 1 of 5 participants associated it with productivity or calendars.

- ### Team Action (if any):
  Reevaluate the team name to better align with the app’s identity. Brainstorm alternatives that convey organization, scheduling, or student productivity, and discuss them in the next team meeting.
