## Dez:
  - ### A/B Test Name: Generic vs Role-Based Onboarding
  - ### User Story Number: US 6 - Metrics
  - ### Metrics: Net Promoter Score, Retention Rate, Daily Active Users
  - ### Hypothesis: Users that are given an interface tailored to their role are more likely to adopt features quicker and continue using the app compared to those with a generic page.
  - ### What problem are we trying to solve and its impact: We believe that many users may be inclined to stop using our app if their front page is generic and contains input fields not tailored to their role regardless of said role. Instead, users can be met with an onboarding page that includes "courses you teach" for educators or "courses you attend" for students, for just some simple ideas. This will in turn result in more users staying with our app.
  - ### Experiment: We will utilize Firebase Remote Config to randomly assign 50% of our users a version with a generic onboarding screen and the other 50% with a tailored one. Then, we will observe the Firebase Analytics to see how our metrics change between the two versions.
  - ### Variations: For version A, users will be placed in a generic dashboard screen with no prompts tailored to their role and no guidance. For version B, users instead will see prompts based on their roles on the onboarding screen. For example, students will see a prompt to add enrolled courses and assignment deadlines, educators will be prompted to added the courses they teach and when to schedule assignments for, and general users will be prompted to add work or personal events.
