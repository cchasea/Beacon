# Beacon

A unified academic, extracurricular, and productivity dashboard for college students.

1. Purpose

Beacon is a cross-platform web and mobile app designed to help college students manage their academic, work, and extracurricular schedules in one unified dashboard.
It integrates assignments, deadlines, and personal events from learning management systems (LMS) such as Brightspace and Canvas, as well as Google Calendar, while using AI to recommend personalized study sessions and reminders.

2. Background

College students often struggle to balance multiple priorities — classes, part-time jobs, and social commitments — across several disconnected platforms.
Deadlines from systems like Brightspace, Canvas, and Google Calendar are fragmented and hard to track, resulting in missed assignments and increased stress.

Beacon addresses this by merging everything into one place and offering AI-powered productivity tools to promote better time management and reduce cognitive overload.

Key integrations:

Google Calendar API for event synchronization

Brightspace/Canvas APIs for course deadlines and assignment data

Firebase for secure authentication and data storage

FlutterFlow for cross-platform app deployment

3. Terminology and References

LMS (Learning Management System): Platforms like Brightspace and Canvas used for course management.

AI Study Block: A suggested study interval generated using workload and schedule data.

Freemium Model: Base app is free, with optional paid campus-wide or productivity upgrade features.

FlutterFlow: A low-code platform for building web and mobile apps using Google’s Flutter framework.

4. Example Usage
// Example: Retrieve assignment deadlines from Brightspace API
final assignments = await BrightspaceService.fetchAssignments(userId);

// Example: Generate AI-powered study block suggestion
final studyPlan = AIPlanner.suggestBlocks(assignments, availableHours: 4);


This snippet demonstrates the logic flow for syncing user assignments and generating recommended study plans.

7. Structure and Cognitive Funnel

This README is structured to provide:

Immediate understanding of the app’s purpose

Background and motivation for development

Technical details and setup instructions

Example code and integration overview

Additional context and licensing

Readers can skim for quick context or read deeply for full implementation details.

8. Caveats and Limitations

Currently in prototype (MVP) stage with limited live deployment.

LMS integration requires institutional API keys or student login authorization.

Future updates will expand support for additional platforms and advanced analytics.
